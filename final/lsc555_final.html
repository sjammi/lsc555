<p>Final Project</p>

<div style="border: 2px solid black; padding: 3px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Client Background and Objectives</h2>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Background</h3>
    <p>
        Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) is our client for this system analysis of the Learning Management System (LMS) Schoology. FCPS wants an external evaluation of Schoology due to complaints from all day-to-day users (teachers, parents, and students) about the usability of the platform. They have also requested feedback that can be forwarded to Schoology to make improvements to the platform for future usage. Complaints have centered primarily on the complexity of the interface for young students, the lack of flexibility in the platform for parents and teachers, and the consistent need for support from third party sources like librarians. As the analysis progressed, we limited the scope of this project to only include parents and students. Although we were able to get general teacher input, the analysis was restricted to the view of students and parents given the level of access granted.
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Quotes from FCPS Staff about Schoology</h3>
    <p>
        “As a school librarian, I see the potential of Schoology as a learning management system, but it often feels like the library’s role gets lost in the shuffle. The platform could do a better job of integrating library resources. Our students are familiar with the system at this point, but we were getting so many questions and comments about library resources being difficult to access through Schoology that we now just direct them to our library website, which we’ve found to be much more user-friendly for students and parents.” - FCPS, HS Librarian
    </p>
    <p>
        "I find Schoology can be overwhelming for younger students. While it has great features, it would be much more effective if the interface was simplified for different age groups. Additionally, integrating more interactive, kid-friendly tools would help engage our younger learners and make accessing library resources easier for them." – FCPS, Elementary Librarian
    </p>
    <p>
        "As a (high school) English teacher, I appreciate the organization that Schoology offers, but I wish it provided more flexibility, particularly for sharing content and grading, and integrating external resources. Additionally, the constant notifications (for assignments, messages, minor changes, etc.) are distracting. The system is not immune to technical glitches, often being down or extremely slow to load.” – FCPS, HS English Teacher

    <h2>Description of Information System</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.powerschool.com/personalized-learning-cloud/schoology-learning/">Schoology</a>
        is a LMS that enables blended learning and is one of the cloud-based features offered by
        <a href="https://www.powerschool.com/">PowerSchool</a>. The LMS "can be used to assign, assess, and collaborate in and out of school, no matter the type of devices students are using or where they are learning" (Personalized Learning, 2025, p. 7). Schoology connects students, faculty, and parents to assignments, messaging, calendars, curriculum, and course templates.  It contains data on student strengths and areas for growth that can be helpful for students, families, and teachers. It has automatic syncing and passback of attendance, traditional grades, and standards-based grades. Teachers can also use Schoology to source content for instruction, assignments, and assessments.

        <br><br>Schoology can be connected to other PowerSchool features to create a customizable document management system they refer to as a Student Management System (SMS), or Student Information System (SIS). This is a centralized, integrated data platform for secure data storage, management, and access. “This software system manages information for schools, and it often protects student, staff, and family data. An SMS or SIS can help with scheduling along with other resources and tools that schools need to maintain an accurate and useful database around their student body and daily operations” (PowerSchool, 2025, n.p.). PowerSchool’s SMS can connect the LMS to assessment information such as student performance data from local benchmarks, state assessments, third-party diagnostic assessments or data sets, attendance, behavior, and live transactional data such as surveys.

        <br><br>Librarians can use a LMS to promote existing services such as reference desk help, research consultations, one-shot instruction sessions, for-credit courses, and the library website. A librarian’s reference work is supported by the use of a LMS because the instructor can endorse the librarian as an information expert, research assistance can be provided online where a student may be more comfortable, and allows the librarian to market their services. Similar to other instructors, librarians can use the LMS to provide synchronous and asynchronous lessons, follow up on questions in a discussion board, link to resources, and provide instructions on relevant research strategies. A LMS can enhance a library’s website as well. Students may have trouble navigating the catalog or determining which database or other resources are most appropriate. A librarian can streamline the list of databases and finding tools relevant to a course or assignment in the LMS.

<h1>Hueristic Evaluation</h1>

<div style="border: 2px solid black; padding: 3px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Nielsen's Usability Evaluation</h2>
    <ol style="text-align:left;"> 
        <li>
            <b>Visibility of System Status:</b> While Schoology usability is arguably okay, new users might find the homepage's initial navigation unclear, as it isn’t immediately obvious where to begin.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Match Between System and the Real World:</b> The settings icon is not the commonly recognized gear symbol, suggesting a minor disconnect from typical user expectations.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>User Control and Freedom:</b> Although navigation is generally considered straightforward, initial difficulties with single sign-on logins and the presence of inaccessible links hinders users' ability to freely access and utilize the site's features.
        </li>
        <div style="padding: 15px; padding-left: 10px">
            <img src="./img/error_broken_path.png" width="350px" height="250px" padding-left="10px" style="float: right; border: 1px solid black"/>
            <img src="./img/error_unused_pages.png" width="350px" height="250px" padding-left="10px" style="float: right; border: 1px solid black"/>
        </div>
        <li>
            <b>Consistency and Standards:</b> Schoology demonstrates good internal consistency in its visual elements like fonts and layout. However, the repetition of information in different areas for the same user might point to underlying inconsistencies in the site's information architecture. Further, our research indicates that there is no consistency of standards within a single school district. Schools are able to determine their own standards and guidelines for the site, which differ from other versions of the site at other schools in the same district.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Error Prevention:</b> Issues with logging in and encountering broken links are opportunities to implement stronger error prevention measures or provide more informative error messages when these problems arise.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Recognition Rather Than Recall:</b> While the navigation is generally intuitive, the "All Parents/Guardians" section's limited content until a switch to the student view might require users to recall or anticipate the features available under different account types.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use:</b> The ability to toggle between parent and child accounts offers some flexibility. However, the observed underutilization of white space on user pages could indicate missed chances to create more efficient or personalized layouts for different user needs.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:</b> Schoology could enhance its aesthetic by improving the use of white space and considering the removal or hiding of less relevant information to create a cleaner interface.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors:</b> Instances of login failures and broken links on Schoology underscore the need for clearer and more helpful error messages. While a support link exists, these evaluations didn't assess the quality of error guidance within the application itself.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Help and Documentation:</b> Although Schoology provides a support link, the site has limited functionality for parents. Parents are unable to see information that may be helpful to help their children succeed. They are limited to seeing a few announcements and links, which is vastly different from the child’s view. This could be due to the settings that the particular school set up, but it is a site that is frequented by parents in order to stay abreast of their child’s school life and experience. Documentation would be useful to allow parents to better engage with their side of the site.
        </li>

    <h2>Possible Improvements</h2>
    <h3>General Suggestions</h3>
    <p>
        <ul style="text-align:left;">
            <li>
                <b>Speed & Stability Improvements</b>: Ensuring the platform loads quickly and has minimal downtime would be crucial for all users. The system often goes down during critical times, such as the beginning of the year and during testing windows.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Reduced Complexity</b>: Streamlining features and reducing unnecessary complexity can help users find what they need without confusion.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Improvements for Parents</h3>
    <p>
        <ul style="text-align:left;">
            <li>
                <b>Direct Messaging</b>: The ability to direct message a teacher would facilitate easier, more timely communication. 
            </li>
            <div style="padding: 15px; padding-right: 10px">
                <img src="./img/notifications_parent.png" width="400px" height="300px" padding-left="10px" style="float: right; border: 1px solid black"/>
            </div>
            <li>
                <b>Customizable Notifications</b>: Parents need more detailed, customizable notifications about their child’s assignments, grades, or issues. The ability to set alerts for specific subjects or even daily/weekly summaries could be helpful.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Easier Access to Reports</b>: Parents want more straightforward access to their child’s academic progress, with clearer visualizations of grades, assignment performance, and attendance. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Language Support</b>: More language options would be beneficial. Glad to see some are available but, for FCPS at least, Chinese/Mandarin is not. Additionally, having more of the site translated when the language is switched would be beneficial.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Improvements for Students</h3>
    <p>
        <ul style="text-align:left;">
            <li>
                <b>Customization Options</b>: Allow students to personalize their dashboard or homepage layout to prioritize what matters most to them (assignments, grades, announcements, etc.).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Instant Feedback on Assignments</b>: Students need real-time updates when grades are posted or when teachers comment. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Grade Visibility</b>: The ability for teachers to provide more detailed feedback, to include in-line assignment notes, on what contributed to specific grades would help students improve.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Mobile App Enhancements</b>: Many students use mobile devices for Schoology, so an optimized mobile app should be prioritized.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Offline Access</b>: The ability to access at least some course materials offline is needed, especially for students who may not always have reliable internet access.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Solutions</h3>
    <p>
        We suggest that Schoology develops Focus Groups (to include students, teachers, and parents) to seek to better understand actual user needs and preferences and gather quantitative data while identifying real-life pain points.
    </p>
</div>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<div style="border: 2px solid black; padding: 3px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <p style="text-align:left;">
        Schoology is a useful, fairly intuitive system for students and parents, but teachers and the school system could have better consistency in standards (which would, hopefully, mean providing more information to students and parents.) 
        Anecdotes and our research indicated a general dislike of the system’s inflexibility (to tailor views) and general lack of parents’ ability to engage with the system. 
        <br><br>Hopefully, by utilizing feedback from focus groups , Schoology can make improvements to enable the system to better serve its clientele.
