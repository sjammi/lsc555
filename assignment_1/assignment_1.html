        <h1>System Introduction</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://library.arlingtonva.us/">This website</a> is hosted by and provides information and data for the Arlington County public libraries. The site supports searching through their collections, services, and events. They also provide general library information such as hours and locations, and news related to the library. Finally, the site includes functionality to create an account, as well as logging in and seeing information related to your account (checkouts, lists, reading history, and holds). While the site supports account creation and acquiring a library card, a user still has to physically go to a library branch in person to verify their ID and address. Some features of the site are visible but inaccessible without an account. Several other services are also provided, such as access to their digital content and links to assorted information databases.
                </p>
            <h2>Users</h2>
                <p>
                    The Arlington County public library website is designed to inform and support patrons of the library, as well as any interested users. While all users can see the content available on the site, but some features (access to some databases, external apps like Libby, etc.) are gated behind account access.
                    The main landing page has several available links for potential users to direct them towards desired content:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A</li>
                    <li>Babies & preschoolers</li>
                    <li>Elementary schoolers</li>
                    <li>Teens</li>
                    <li>Job seekers</li>
                    <li>Makers & crafters</li>
                    <li>Book lovers</li>
                </ol>
            <h2>Content</h2>
                <p>The library site offers quite a lot of content:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Collections - access to their catalog of books and other content via <a href="https://libcat.arlingtonva.us/?browseCategory=c_popular">Libcat</a> (complete with search and filter functionality), digital collections for videos and digital books, and access to information resources such as JSTOR and other databases.</li>
                    <li>Services - information on available services as well as information on how to access/use each service.</li>
                    <li>Events - events can be found either in calendar format, or by program, or by searching for a specific one.</li>
                </ol>
        <h1>Discussion</h1>
            <h2>Unique Features</h2>
                <p>I’m surprised by how many offerings the library has available in fully digital format. Aside from some services that can only be done at a physical location in many ways the site acts as a complete virtual interface for a library patron. One thing in particular that caught my eye is the ability to reach out to librarians directly via a web form, where patrons can as questions and receive responses via email. Another is that their entire catalog is searchable and that includes not only books and digital books, but also research tools, games, and toys for children among other things. Finally, book lists are available for people seeking recommendations for their next read.</p>
            <h2>Pros & Cons</h2>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Pro</th>
                        <th>Con</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>accessible</th>
                        <th>site navigation could be improved</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>works on mobile</th>
                        <th>not clear what is available digitally or in person</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>clearly details library offerings</th>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
                <p>
                    Aside from some possible changes to the visual aesthetic of the website, I don’t have any major suggestions for the Arlington County public library website. Even then, visual changes would be purely dependent on the desired aesthetic, since everything seems to be fairly well designed for general usage. One thing I would note is that it may be good to make it more clear to users what content and services are available digitally versus what can be read about online but must be done in person. The navigation at the top could also be adapted to include more direct links to their services or the catalog, which otherwise can only be accessed from the main page.
